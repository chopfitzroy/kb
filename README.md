# Knowledgebase

This is my personal knowledgebase.

There is no fancy tooling here I use [Helix](https://helix-editor.com/) and [Marksman](https://github.com/artempyanykh/marksman) to edit documents and [Lume](https://lume.land/) to generate static markup.

### Why Lume?

It's simple and let's me hack using TypeScript.

If I wanted something more fully featured I would look to either [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) or [Astro](https://astro.build/).
