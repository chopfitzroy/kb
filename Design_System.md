# Design Systems

Writing good design systems is difficult. Fortunately tools like [React](https://react.dev/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) make this process much easier.

## Primitives

Largely inspired by [Brad Frost's](https://bradfrost.com/) book [Atomic Design](https://shop.bradfrost.com/) I like to create components to cover the most basic tasks.

I call these components primitives because they are the _building blocks_ on which we build our components.

I typically split primitives into two categories, **static** and **interactive** in theory these categories could be done away with, but they help me to get into the write mindset whenever I am creating new primitives.

### Static primitives

### Interactive primitives

## Headless components

### Rendering

### Typing

### Composing
